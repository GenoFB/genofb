# 👋 Hi! I'm Genaro Flores

🔭 I’m in my final semester of Computer Engineering in Santiago, Chile, currently completing a remote Full-Stack internship at Laureate. I’m also working on my capstone (titulación) project and learning React Native in parallel to bring it to life.  

☕ When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying a good coffee alongside my cats, my favorite productivity booster. (I love Dogs too! 🐶)
